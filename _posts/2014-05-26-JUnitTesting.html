JUnit is a great tool that enables Java developers to easily test their code. The primary goal of
unit testing is to take the smallest piece of testable software in the application, isolate it from
the remainder of the code, and determine whether it behaves exactly as you expect.<sup><a

 In Java, methods are often the smallest pieces of testable software. JUnit allows you to test individual
methods by defining input and making assertions about what the output should be for those inputs.
<p><hr></p>
Let's dive right in with an example of some code that could use some testing:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
public class StringSearch {
    /**
     * Returns the first string in the array that starts with the given character. If no String is
     * found, null is returned. The order of the strings in the array is not changed.
     *
     * @param strings     the array of Strings to search
     * @param firstLetter the first letter to search for
     * @return the first name beginning with the given letter or null otherwise
     */
    public static String findFirstOccurence(String[] strings, char firstLetter) {
        for (String string : strings) {
            if (string.charAt(0) == firstLetter) {
                return string;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
</pre>
<br>
Let's create a new file that will contain all of our test code for the above class. Standard practice is to
name the file <span class="vartag">[Classname]Test.java</span> to indicate which class you are testing in that file.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertNull;

public class StringSearchTest {
    private static String[] strings;

    @Before
    public void initialize() {
        strings = new String[]{"bob", "joe", "sue", "max", "jan"};
    }

    @Test
    public void testSuccessfulFind() {
        String result = StringSearch.findFirstOccurence(strings, 'j');
        assertEquals("joe", result);
    }

    @Test
    public void testUnsuccessfulFind() {
        String result = StringSearch.findFirstOccurence(strings, 'z');
        assertNull(result);
    }

    @Test
    public void testNullArray() {
        String result = StringSearch.findFirstOccurence(null, 'z');
        assertNull(result);
    }
}
</pre>
JUnit is not part of the standard java library, so the import statements in lines 1-4 will not resolve without
importing JUnit into your project.
<br>
If you are using Maven, you can add the following to your pom.xml file:
<br>
<div class="label">
&lt;dependencies&gt;
<br>
&emsp;&lt;dependency&gt;
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&lt;groupId&gt;junit&lt;/groupId&gt;
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&lt;artifactId&gt;junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&lt;version&gt;4.11&lt;/version&gt;
<br>
&emsp;&lt;/dependency&gt;
<br>
&lt;/dependencies&gt;
</div>
<br>
Otherwise, you can download JUnit from <a href="https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Download-and-Install" target="_blank">here</a>
and put the .jar file on your project's classpath.
<p></p>
Now that we have the import statements working, let's dissect the testing code.
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums:8">
    private static String[] strings;

    @Before
    public void initialize() {
        strings = new String[]{"bob", "joe", "sue", "max", "jan"};
    }
</pre>
This code segment initializes the input for all of the tests that we will run. The <span class="annotationtag">@Before</span>
annotation tells JUnit to run the method before every test. This is useful for setting up
variables that will be used in every test. In this case, every test will have the same input array.
<p>
Additionally, you can use the <span class="annotationtag">@After</span> annotation to tell JUnit to
run a method after every test.
<p>
JUnit can also run methods once for the entire testing program. The <span class="annotationtag">@BeforeClass</span>
annotation tells JUnit to execute a method before any tests are run. The <span class="annotationtag">@AfterClass</span>
annotation tells JUnit to execute a method after all tests have been run. This is useful for creating and then closing network or database connections
needed by the tests.
</p>
<p></p>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums:15">
    @Test
    public void testSuccessfulFind() {
        String result = StringSearch.findFirstOccurence(strings, 'j');
        assertEquals("joe", result);
    }
</pre>
The <span class="annotationtag">@Test</span> annotation tells JUnit that this method represents an
individual test. Line 17 gets the output from the method we are testing using the input we defined earlier.
Line 18 is where the magic happens: it tells JUnit that the correct value of <span class="vartag">result</span> should be
<span class="stringtag">"joe"</span>. If this assertion does not hold, the test will fail and JUnit will
inform you of the failure. In this case, the assertion holds and the test passes.
<p></p>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums:21">
    @Test
    public void testUnsuccessfulFind() {
        String result = StringSearch.findFirstOccurence(strings, 'z');
        assertNull(result);
    }
</pre>
This test is very similar to the previous test but instead of asserting that <span class="vartag">result</span>
should have a specific value, we are asserting that it should be <span class="keytag">null</span>. The
Javadoc for the <span class="vartag">findFirstOccurence</span> method states that <span class="keytag">null</span>
will be returned if no String in the array begins with the given character. Since the input array has no
String beginning with <span class="stringtag">'z'</span> this test passes.
<p></p>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums:27">
    @Test
    public void testNullArray() {
        String result = StringSearch.findFirstOccurence(null, 'z');
        assertNull(result);
    }
</pre>
The final test is almost exactly like the previous one except this time we are passing in a
<span class="keytag">null</span> array. Unfortunately, the code we wrote does not check if the input array is <span class="keytag">null</span>
and will thus throw a <span class="typetag">NullPointerException</span> when called. As you would expect, exceptions will cause a JUnit
test to fail. If we want to have this JUnit test pass we will need to modify our code to check
for <span class="keytag">null</span> arrays OR tell JUnit that we expect an exception to occur.
<p></p>
For the sake of learning, let's assume that we WANT a <span class="typetag">NullPointerException</span> to be thrown if a <span class="keytag">null</span> array
is passed to the method. In order to get the JUnit test to pass, we modify the code to be:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums:27">
    @Test(expected = NullPointerException.class)
    public void testNullArray() {
        String result = StringSearch.findFirstOccurence(null, 'z');
    }
</pre>
The <span class="vartag">expected</span> clause on the <span class="annotationtag">@Test</span> annotation
lets JUnit know that a <span class="typetag">NullPointerException</span> should be thrown SOMEWHERE in this method. This approach is
not very precise as ANY line in the test that throws a <span class="typetag">NullPointerException</span> will cause the test to pass.
<p></p>
A more precise way to check for an exception is the following:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums:27">
    @Rule
    public ExpectedException exception = ExpectedException.none();

    @Test
    public void testNullArray() {
        exception.expect(NullPointerException.class);
        String result = StringSearch.findFirstOccurence(null, 'z');
    }
</pre>
The <span class="typetag">ExpectedException</span> class handles more precise exception expectations
by examining a single line of code in the test. In this case, the <span class="vartag">expect</span>
method called in line 31 tells JUnit that the next line (line 32) should throw a <span class="typetag">NullPointerException</span>. Any line
of code that throws an exception and is not preceded by a call to <span class="vartag">expect</span> will
cause the test to fail.
<p></p>
One caveat of the <span class="vartag">expect</span> method is that it will cause the test to either pass
or fail immediately. No further lines of code in the test will be executed.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums:27">
    @Rule
    public ExpectedException exception = ExpectedException.none();

    @Test
    public void testNullArray() {
        exception.expect(NullPointerException.class);
        String result = StringSearch.findFirstOccurence(null, 'z');
        System.out.println("hello");
    }
</pre>
This test will successfuly pass, but the <span class="stringtag">"hello"</span> in line 34 will not be
printed out because the test will terminate immediately after line 33.
